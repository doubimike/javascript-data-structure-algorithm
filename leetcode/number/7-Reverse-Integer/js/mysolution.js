// Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

// Example 1:

// Input: 123
// Output:  321
// Example 2:

// Input: -123
// Output: -321
// Example 3:

// Input: 120
// Output: 21
// Note:
// Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only hold integers within the 32-bit signed integer range. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

// Have you thought about this? Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!
// If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.
// Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?
// For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
